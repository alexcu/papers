\section{Model}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What data is used to train the model?
  \item Pre-processing steps needed to `clean' the data. How does this affect the raw data itself?
  \item Additional models used to train this model?
  \item How can I update it? Is it locked down or can I use transfer learning?
\end{itemize}
