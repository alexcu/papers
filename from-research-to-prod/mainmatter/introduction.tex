\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A gap between the `theoretical' research and implementing this into `practical' product.
  \item The transition from research into an actual product.
  \item \textbf{Four-step process from pre-research in NN to the `accessible' layer}: pre-research; NN architecture paper + initial implementation; commercial implementation (industry/production grade); accessible layer (DSL that is user friendly).
  \item Various roles for each `step': Scientist/Researcher; Postdoc/PhD; Library Maintainer Engineer (Domain Specific); General Developer
  \item Thus, various skillsets needed. What are the gaps?
  \item In addition, need the model and data to make it work: need all three.
