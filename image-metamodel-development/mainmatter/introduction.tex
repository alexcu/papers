\section{Introduction}

In the last two decades, image-detection systems have seen practical applications within various domains \citep{Tsai:2010cn,Girod:2011gw,Takacs:2008cg,Sivic:2003tj,Lowe:2004kp,Bay:2008ud,Jin:2016jd,Smeulders:2000tx}, but only recently has there been an apparent shift from heuristic-driven systems to machine-learning ones. Since the advancement of the \glspl{cnn} from handwritten characters \citep{Lecun:1998hy} to object detection \citep{Krizhevsky:2012wl} on the ImageNet dataset, we have seen increasing interest in improving the \gls{cnn} \cite{Girshick:2014jx,Girshick:2015vr,Ren:2017ug,He:2017ud}. It is typical for an image-based \gls{cnn} classifier to require thousands of training samples, and therefore providing quality, annotated labels is critical.

In this paper, we
